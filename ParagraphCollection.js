    paragraph1 : `To be more accurate, however, Crusoe’s reactionto the choice presented to
him gives us no more than the social rate of discount for the one year and, for
that matter, is strictly valid only for 100 bushels of corn this year, not for more or
for less. If, indeed, the same rate of discount did hold for successive years, then
Crusoe would be indifferent as between 100 today, 120 next year, 144 in the year
following that, and so on. It is, however, quite possible that his discount rate rises
with the passage of time. Instead of being indifferent as between 100 today and
144 intwo years’ time, he might specify 150 intwo years’ time. This would mean
that for the first year his rate of discount is 20 per cent, but for the second year he
uses a discount rate of roughly 25 per cent per annum.`,
    paragraph2 : `Persons whose taxable income from
employment is earned wholly or partly in
foreign currency must pay tax in the same or
another specified foreign currency on so much
of that income as is earned in that currency.
(Section 4A of the Finance Act).
Where a person earns any part of his or her
taxable income in the form of a coupon or any
instrument or token that, in the opinion of the
Commissioner, is exchangeable, whether
directly or indirectly, for foreign currency, that
person shall pay an amount of tax to the
Commissioner in foreign currency calculated
on a valuation of that coupon, instrument or
token which, in the opinion of the
Commissioner, represents a fair valuation of
that coupon, instrument or token in foreign
currency.

    paragraph3 : `A component is a unit of software that
performs some function at run-time. Examples include programs, objects, processes, and
filters.” This raises an important distinction between software architecture and what is
typically referred to as software structure: the former is an abstraction of the run-time
behavior of a software system, whereas the latter is a property of the static software source
code. Although there are advantages to having the modular structure of the source code
match the decomposition of behavior within a running system, there are also advantages to
having independent software components be implemented using parts of the same code`,
    paragraph4 : `A huge part about being a pentester is being able to find vulnerability in applications and services.
From the Nmap scans, vulnerability scans, and from poking around, you will identify all sorts of
versions for these applications and services.`,
    paragraph5 : `A huge part about being a pentester is being able to find vulnerability in applications and services.
From the Nmap scans, vulnerability scans, and from poking around, you will identify all sorts of
versions for these applications and services.`,
    paragraph6 : `Consumers are attracted to opportunities to save money, and merchants
need to keep older inventory moving out the door to make room for shiny
new goodies. So you may want to take advantage of this situation and put a
sign in the window showing that all items are discounted by 40 percent`,
    paragraph7 : `Deflation is a negative inflation, which implies that the inflation rate falls below 0%. Deflation is the declining price of goods and services. It happens during the economic recession. 
Phenomenon like, decreasing in money supply, government expenses, consumer demand, and 
business investment, all occur during the period of deflation.`
